### **Briefly about myself**


My career path began with graphic design after completing the relevant courses in 2020. Having mastered Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and other graphic editors at a high level, I began developing designs for companies/customers, including creating a unique brand/company style, various identities, and much more on outsourcing platforms.


After I "develop a knack", I came across the profession of a UI/UX designer, which in turn interested me very much and I decided to expand my knowledge in this area.


At the moment, I am a senior UI/UX designer (with three-year experience) at WayALay company and have worked on such projects as: Tennis League, Euromall, and WayAlay as well. I decided to master the specialization of a web developer in order to better understand the development process and the "internal kitchen" of applications.


I have developed communication skills that allow me to interact effectively with colleagues and clients. I consider myself as a team player, able to easily adapt to different work styles/conditions, and I actively participate in group discussions to achieve main goals.
